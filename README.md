# Supervisor Deployment Guide

This README provides a guide on how to use Supervisor to manage and control process states in a UNIX-like operating system, which is particularly useful for managing long-running Python scripts or other server processes.

## Prerequisites

- Linux server
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands

## Installing Supervisor

1. **Install Supervisor on your Linux server:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install supervisor
   ```

## Configuring Supervisor

1. **Create a configuration file for your program:**
   - Supervisor configuration files are typically stored in `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/`.
   - Here is an example configuration for a Python script:

   ```ini
   [program:your_program]
   command=python /path/to/your_script.py
   autostart=true
   autorestart=true
   stderr_logfile=/var/log/your_program.err.log
   stdout_logfile=/var/log/your_program.out.log
   ```

2. **Reload Supervisor configuration:**
   - After setting up your configuration file, update Supervisor with the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo supervisorctl reread
   sudo supervisorctl update
   ```

## Managing Your Program with Supervisor

1. **Basic Supervisor commands:**
   - To start your program:
     ```bash
     sudo supervisorctl start your_program
     ```
   - To stop your program:
     ```bash
     sudo supervisorctl stop your_program
     ```
   - To check the status of your program:
     ```bash
     sudo supervisorctl status
     ```

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up Supervisor to manage your applications. This setup ensures that your programs remain running and restart automatically in case of failure.
